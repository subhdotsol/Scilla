# **Scilla — An Interactive Solana CLI**

**Scilla** is a fast, developer-friendly interactive command-line interface for Solana.
Instead of manually typing long CLI flags, Scilla uses intelligent prompting to help you build and execute commands seamlessly — making the workflow far less tedious.

With Scilla, you can easily **inspect on-chain data**, **query cluster state**, **send transactions**, and perform a wide range of Solana development and debugging tasks — all from a unified interactive shell.

## **Quick Start**

### **1. Install**

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/blueshift-gg/Scilla
cd Scilla
cargo install --path .
```
---

## **Usage**

Launch Scilla and you'll see:

```bash 
scilla
```

``` bash
⚡ Scilla — Hacking Through the Solana Matrix

? Choose a command group:
  > Account
    Cluster
    Stake
    Vote
    ScillaConfig
    Exit
```

Navigate using arrow keys, press Enter to select.

### **2. Run & Configure**

```bash
# Go to ScillaConfig > Generate ScillaConfig 

⚡ Scilla — Hacking Through the Solana Matrix
> Choose a command group: ScillaConfig
? ScillaConfig Command:
  Show ScillaConfig
> Generate ScillaConfig
  Edit ScillaConfig

```

This will generate a config file with your desired parameters. For example:

```toml
rpc-url = "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
keypair-path = "~/.config/solana/id.json"
commitment-level = "confirmed"
```

You can then edit the generated `~/.config/scilla.toml` going to ScillaConfig > Edit ScillaConfig, or manually editing the file.

## Roadmap

Scilla is under active development. Here's what we're working towards:

### V1 — Full Solana CLI Compatibility

The goal for V1 is to provide interactive equivalents for all core Solana CLI commands. This includes completing the remaining commands marked as "Todo" in the tables above:

- Account: Transfer
- Stake: Create, Delegate, Show
- Full parity with `solana` CLI functionality

### V2 — Extended Ecosystem Features

Once V1 is stable, we'll expand Scilla's capabilities to include:

- SPL Token operations (create, mint, transfer, burn)
- Local validator management (spin up, configure, manage test validators)
- Token metadata and NFT utilities
- Enhanced transaction building and simulation
